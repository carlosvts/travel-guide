## üöÄ Installation

Follow these steps to get TravelGuide up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.6 or higher

* `pip` (Python package installer)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository (or download the source code):**

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/travelguide.git
Or if you downloaded a zip: unzip travelguide-main.zip


2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

cd travelguide


3. **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
It's best practice to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python projects.

python3 -m venv venv


4. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

* **macOS / Linux:**

  ```
  source venv/bin/activate
  
  ```

* **Windows (Command Prompt)::**

  ```
  venv\Scripts\activate.bat
  
  ```

* **Windows (PowerShell):**

  ```
  .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
  
  ```

5. **Install the Project:**
With your virtual environment active, install TravelGuide using pip. The `.` indicates installing from the current directory.

pip install .


*If you make changes to the code, you can reinstall with `pip install . --force-reinstall`.*

## üí° Usage

Once installed, you can use the `travelguide` command directly from your terminal, no matter which directory you are in (as long as your virtual environment is active).
